"""Regression tests for the field_operation_worker view-only module.

The module ships no model: it layers worker-specific views, an action and a
menu on top of ``field.operation``. The tests below pin the behaviour that was
either broken or unverified:

* installation used to abort with a ``ParseError`` because the form view kept
  commented-out ``<button>`` nodes (``action_planned`` / ``action_cancel`` /
  ``action_draft``) inside its ``<header>``: the view validator walks commented
  nodes in v19, so dead XML now fails the module install. Every worker view is
  checked to be free of ``<!--`` nodes.
* the four views reused the exact base names (``field.operation.form`` ...),
  which makes them indistinguishable from the core module views; they must now
  carry the ``.worker`` suffix.
* the action, its ``ir.actions.act_window.view`` links, the menu groups and the
  ``my_jobs`` filter were never asserted.
* the ``my_jobs`` default filter is a search filter, not a security boundary:
  the actual visibility comes from the base record rule ``rule_service_worker``
  (``person_ids.user_id = user.id`` and ``status in (planned, progress)``).
